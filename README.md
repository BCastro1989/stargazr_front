Stargazr is a webapp to help you find great spots to go stargazing near you.

By gathering data about factors that effect stargazing quality from different sites and services, Stargazr creates a one-stop-shop for finding out all you need to pick a great spot to look up at the night sky.

Stargazr currently gives you the following information for a chosen stargazing site:
- Lunar Phase (in % of Full)
- Humidity (Affects how transparent atmosphere is, and causes condensation on telescopes)
- Cloud Cover
- Precipitation Probability
- Elevation (Higher Elevation means less atmosphere above you to distort night sky)
- Light Pollution (Based on 2006 data provided by D. Lorenz)
- Distance from current location
- Driving time from current location
- Nearest Clear Dark Sky Chart (Charts are made by A. Danko, selected sites only during testing phatse)

**This project is still in development.** There are some bugs (mostly with styling/responsiveness) and many features not yet implimented. Some features yet to be added are:
- Forcast for next several days
- International Space Station overpass
- Galaxies, Nebulas, Etc visible from that site at that time
- Planets visible from that site at that time
